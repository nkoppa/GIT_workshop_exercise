Concentration of R&D: The research suggests that R&D, which drives technological progress, is concentrated in a small set of countries.

Two Schools of Thought:
a. One school believes that transformative technological knowledge is broadly applicable and easily transmittable. Technology diffusion from innovation-intensive frontiers can erode global disparities in the long run.
b. Another school emphasizes that new technologies are attached to specific conditions and characteristics of production, hindering their diffusion to other contexts. Inappropriatetechnology hypothesis suggests that innovation focus on local conditions inhibits global productivity benefits.
